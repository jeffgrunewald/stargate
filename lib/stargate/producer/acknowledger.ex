  By default, `Stargate.produce/2` will block the calling

  to an asynchronous acknowledgement by passing an MFA tuple to
  `Stargate.produce/3`.

  This modules defines a GenServer process that
  works in tandem with a producer websocket connection
  to wait for and send receipt acknowledgements received
  from produce operations to the calling process or otherwise
